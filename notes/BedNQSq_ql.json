To use a different directory, set the default_root_dir argument in the Trainer.\n\n    Trainer(default_root_dir=\"/your/custom/path\")","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/Tutorial/Pytorch_Lightning/Basic/Debug, visualize and find performance bottlenecks","data":{},"createdAt":"2024-02-22T08:19:10.436Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-22T08:27:29.596Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"ARlvNMQQ3"}
